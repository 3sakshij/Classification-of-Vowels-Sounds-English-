# Classification-of-Vowels-Sounds-English - Speech Task 1 

## Introduction 

Speech recognition process of converting the basic speech signal to text. It involves various disciplines from understanding how the different sounds are generated by the human vocal tract to converting the signals to text. 
Signals are generated by speaker which vibrates the vocal chord and speech is produced.Different humans have different signals distribution. 


**Phoemnes** : Unit of sound that distinguish one word from the other

**Formants** : For the purposes of distinguishing vowels from each other, we are more interested in the frequency response curves (indicating the preferred resonating frequencies of the vocal tract) rather than in the raw spectrum of the wave.Each of the preferred resonanting frequencies of the vocal tract (each bump in the frequency response curve) is known as a formant


## Objectives

* To learn and understand the basics of speech recognition. 
* Understanding Speech signals and formants
* Plotting formant plots for different vowel sounds
* Build the basic classification model of the speech algorithm using a distance-based machine learning algorithm. (K means algorithm).

## About Data
Data Needs to be generated using software wave surfer. To compare the different data signals and I took three kinds of the speaker i.e 

## 1. **My Voice** 

Recorded audio for five vowels and extracted formants (F1 and F2)

Observation : Vowels are overlapping and is not present in distinct clusters . Pronunciation of the vowels is not been done correctly.

## 2. **Female Professional Speaker**

Download the Voice of Female speaker pronouncing vowels correctly according to phoneme sequence and extracted formants from this audio. 

## 3. **Male Professional Speaker** 

<img src="Images/Male Professional data plot.JPG" style="height: 500px; width:600px;"/>

Observation : Download Voice of male speaker pronouncing vowels correctly according to phoneme sequence and extracted formants from this audio. 

### Task Complexity 
* Speech is continuous signal and not sequence of elementary sounds.
* Articulation depends on the surrounding sound.
* Noise in the environment 
* Prounciation of the Speaker
